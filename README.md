# Another Useless Script for Your Lazy Lyf

Welcome to the ultimate tool for all your regretful coding moments. Have you ever looked at a repo and thought,
*"Why did I even write this? If only I could erase it from existence"*?
Well, congratulations — your salvation is here.

## What This Script Does

This script deletes your GitHub repositories faster than your last relationship ended. It’s the nuclear option for cleaning up your GitHub profile and finally getting rid of those projects that haunt your dreams.

Think of it as hitting the "Forget Everything" button — except for code. Sorry, no refunds or second chances.

## How to Use This Masterpiece of Self-Sabotage

1. **Clone or Download this script**

2. **Open it in your favorite text editor** — or just open it in something, we don’t care.

3. **Fill in the blanks:**

   * `USERNAME` — Your GitHub username. Yes, the one you’re probably ashamed of.

   * `TOKEN` — Your Personal Access Token (PAT).

     **Important:** This token **must** have **repo deletion permissions** (i.e., admin access to the repositories you want to delete). If you don’t grant the right permissions, this script will politely fail and leave your disasters intact.

     Generate your token here:
     [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

     When creating the token, make sure to check:

     * **repo** (for full control of private repositories)
     * **delete\_repo** (for deleting repositories)

     Without these, your “magical token of doom” is just a useless string.

   * `REPOS` — The list of repositories you want to send to digital purgatory. Add all your "experimental" disasters here. Comments encouraged for dramatic effect.

4. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   bash your_script_name.sh
   ```

5. **Watch as your past mistakes vanish before your eyes.**
   If the curl command fails, don't blame the script — blame your luck or your ability to type credentials wrong.

## Warning

* **Once you delete a repo, it’s gone.** Like that bug you promised to fix last sprint but never did. Forever.
* No tears, no begging, no "just this once" pleas will restore your precious code.
* Use responsibly. Or don’t. It’s your life and your mess.

## For the Brave and Foolhardy

If you’re reading this and still haven’t deleted that cringeworthy code from your GitHub, what are you waiting for? A handwritten apology from the compiler? Time to hit that button.

---

**Go ahead. Delete. Regret later.**
Because sometimes, deleting is the only productive thing you can do.

If you want, I can help you make this script more "explosive" or add some sanity checks. Just ask.
